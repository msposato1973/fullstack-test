ToDo :: Styling with CSS 3

    1. Apply styling so that the elements containing the images are next to each other horizontally

    2. Add a 2px border, the same colour as the h1 element, to the top and bottom of the caption element
       within the element with the page class and alter the caption element to 8 units (relative to the root)

    3. Add a margin, 1 relative unit of the root from the image, to the element that you added the borders to

    4. Apply styling to place same the caption element above the image

    5. Apply styling to place the element with the avatar class so that it is positioned on the right hand side of the page

    6. Add a 2px border, the same colour as the h1 element, to the element with the avatar class so that it appears as a
       circle and has a height / width that is 6 units in size, relative to its parent element.

    7. Change the vertical alignment so that the elements containing the images are aligned to the baseline,
       e.g. the bottom of the images are at the same baseline level

    8. Give the element with the lorem-ipsum class:
        - padding 1 unit relative to the root
        - displays a cursor with a pointing finger
        - a white background colour
        - has rounded corners that are half of a unit relative to its parent
        - a box shadow 25% of black that appears in 0.5s when the cursor is over the element
        - styling the paragraphs so that the left hand edge is inline with the line above
        - Without adding any classes change the second paragraph to rgb(120,0,0)
